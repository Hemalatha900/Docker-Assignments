Assignment - 2 :-

Given that you have instructions to run the go-app ( in prerequisite ) 

1.	Try to create a docker image out of it with the base image of `golang:latest`
2.	Run a container with that image and do a curl request and make sure you are able to see the output. 
3.	Tag the docker image with v1. 
4.	Run docker history, observe and understand the output. 
5.	Push the docker image to your docker hub. 

Note: - use proper names for images, containers.
Dockerfile :
#latest image 
FROM golang:latest
# Working directory 
WORKDIR /go-app
COPY go.mod /go-app/
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main
EXPOSE 8080
#start the command from .main
CMD ["./main"]

docker image build -t hemalathathatigutla/go-app:v2 .
curl http://localhost:8080
docker login 
docker push hemalathathatigutla/go-app:v2
